# TODO

- [X] Add CI: `ansible-galaxy init --role-skeleton=ansible-role-_template example`
- [X] Modify and cleanup `vars/main.yml` to actually work.
- [ ] Make a description for `beginner`, `intermediate` and `advanced`. (maybe just 2.)
- [X] Write an INSTALL.md on how to use this.
- [X] Describe this repositories function in README.md
- [X] Review `meta/main.yml`. (Branding, versions (Ansible 2.9).)

# Maybe
- [ ] Test the role that has been generated. -> The role that is generated has no logic now; it would fail.

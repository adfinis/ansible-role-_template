# The variable `package` is determined by looking a the map above

# `ansible_distribution_major_version` (See
# [this debug](https://gitlab.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-debug/) role for
# possible values.)
# The intent is to find the most specific combination first, and eventually
# falling back to `default`.
# The underscore is to indicate the variable should not be overwritten, there is no enforcement on this, just nice to have.
# In the map above, `curl` is always called curl, so not a very good example, just to illustrate the you can differentiate for different distributions and versions.
